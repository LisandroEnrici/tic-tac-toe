# Tic Tac Toe game with React JS

This project starts with the develop of the application from the [React JS Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) and continue with the customization and some improvements, implementing tools like Redux.

This proyect was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## Project State

The stable release of the app (v2.0) is running on [Glass TicTacToe](https://master--glass-tictactoe.netlify.app).
In this version I have implemented Redux, and made some great visual changes to make it look like glassmorphism.

---

## Future features

The tie situation is pending, and I will add more animations and visual improvements.

## Repository
The project is stored on GitHub: [github.com/LisandroEnrici/tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/LisandroEnrici/tic-tac-toe).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
